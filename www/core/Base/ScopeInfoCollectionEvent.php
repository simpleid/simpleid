 * SimpleID installation can provide, as well as human-friendly
 * information on these scopes.
 * 
 * Scope information is categorised into *types*.  Generally each
 * identity protocol would have a separate type assigned.  Currently
 * the available types are:
 * 
 * - `openid` for the OpenID 1 and 2 protocols
 * - `oauth` for OAuth based protocols (including OpenID Connect)
 * 
 * Listeners should use {@link addScopeInfo()} to add scope information.
