 * Base class to represent an audit event.

 * An audit event represents an action that are typically logged for
 * audit purposes.  An audit event is usually an action performed by
 * a remote user agent affecting a subject (typically a user) or a client.
 * 
 * This base class automatically collects the following additional
 * information:
 * 
 * - the time the event occurred
 * - the IP address of the remote machine
 * - the name of the user agent provided by the remote machine
 * - if the `log_location` configuration variable is set to true,
 *   uses a GeoIP resolver service to resolve the location of the IP
 *   address
