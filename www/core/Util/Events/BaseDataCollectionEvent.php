/**
 * A generic event used to collect data.

 * This class implements f3-event-dispatcher's GenericEventInterface, and
 * therefore the event name is specified by the `$eventName` parameter
 * passed in the constructor.
 * 
 * Listeners add data by calling the {@link addResult()} method.  How
 * this is added to the existing data depends on the merge strategy:
 * 
 * - If the merge strategy is `MERGE_APPEND`, then the result
 *   is appended to the existing data
 * - If the merge strategy is `MERGE_PLAIN`, then the result
 *   is merged to the existing data using `array_merge`
 * - If the merge strategy is `MERGE_RECURSIVE`, then the result
 *   is merged to the existing data using `array_merge_recursive`
 * - If the merge strategy is `MERGE_DEFAULT`, then the result is
 *   appended if it is a scalar, or merged if it is an array
 * 
 * The emitter can retrieve the collected data by calling the
 * {@link getResults()} method.
